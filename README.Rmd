**Note:** The rendered quarto document `Examples_Walkthrough` is a good place to start. It provides easy-to-follow implementation details for Sections 4.1-4.2 in the manuscript (linked here when available). Additional scripts are included to reproduce the results included in Sections 4.1-4.2 as well as some of the results in the Supplemental materials.

This repository contains several R scripts to reproduce the examples found in the (submitted for review) manuscript *Active Subspaces for High Dimensional Computer Models*. To run these scripts, you will need to install the `concordance` and `GBASS` packages (other packages from CRAN may be needed, see `R/setup.R` for details) from public github repos using the commands.

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/concordance")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/GBASS") # only needed for supplemental materials
```
 
 The scripts included in this repository include

   - `Examples_Walkthrough.qmd`
   - `R/A_simple_polynomial.R` (Section 4.1)
   - `R/B_linear_constraint.R` (Section 4.1.1)
   - `R/C_low_dim_structure.R` (Section 4.2)
   - `R/D_polynomial_outliers.R` (Supplemental materials)
   - `R/E_polynomial_quantile.R` (Supplemental materials)
